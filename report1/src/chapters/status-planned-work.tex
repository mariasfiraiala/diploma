\section{Current Status}
\label{sec:current-status}

We are currently working on the main external library, \textit{lib-qemu} \cite{lib-qemu}, for which we decided that a compartmentalization on sub-librariers fits best due to the sheer number of sources and headers.
What's more, we designed a script to pick up the sources and headers that will be used in the build stage of the unikernel.
\labelindexref{Figure}{img:roadmap} clarifies the steps that lead-up to the creation of the \textit{lib-qemu} Unikraft external library and \labelindexref{Listing}{lst:makefile-rules} exemplifies the manner in which we include each's sub-library sources and headers into the build system.

\section{Planned Work}
\label{sec:planned work}

Future steps require we pay attention to the libraries that \textit{lib-qemu} depends on: \textit{lib-pcre2-8}, \textit{lib-cap-ng}, \textit{lib-lzo2}, \textit{lib-slirp} and \textit{lib-gmodule-2.0}, but also to the environment in which the resulting QEMU unikernel will run in, the Xen model device stubdomain, and its requirements.
\labelindexref{Figure}{img:roadmap} displays the near future milestones to be achieved.
