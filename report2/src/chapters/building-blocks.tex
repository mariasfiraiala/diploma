QEMU \cite{qemu} is a machine emulator and virtualizer that aims to support building and executing on a plethora of OSes and for multiple architectures, therefore, we focus on configuring the Unikraft QEMU library to be used for the architectures supported by Unikraft and Xen, that being \textit{x64} and \textit{AArch64}.
Because there's little interest for AArch64 in Qubes OS, we set the sensible objective of building the unikernel only for \textit{x64}.
Even by reducing the target to only one architecture, the total number of sources that would compile in the final Unikraft VM, from the QEMU side \footnote{QEMU is dependent on many external libraries, one of them being GLIBC} is still around 1400.
When it comes to the platform the QEMU unikernel is going to run on, the obvious choice is Xen: it was requested by its community and it will be used by Qubes OS, a project that constructed their product around the type-1 hypervisor.

We created the QEMU port in Unikraft as an external library, \textit{lib-qemu}, which requires multiple other external libraries: some that need to be freshly ported (\textit{lib-seccomp}, \textit{lib-glib}, to name a few), and some that are already part of the Unikraft ecosystem (\textit{lib-musl}, \textit{lib-zlib} and others).
As a result, we take advantage of the already implemented robust make-based build system, to integrate the missing library pieces into the big Unikraft picture.
