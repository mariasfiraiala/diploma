Unikernels represent a novel cloud technology, introduced in the 2010s as a means of providing specialization at low costs.
They are a single-purpose operating system, tightly coupled with the library and application code to achieve small boot times, improved security and efficiency.
Combined with a powerful hypervisor, unikernels become the answer to modern cloud-based problems: effortless migration, secure compartmentalization that exceeds the one of container's and fast deployment.

We propose a new application to be run in such a VM, QEMU, with the purpose of uniting two worlds, the hypervisor, that uses the QEMU unikernel to emulate drivers and the VM toolkit used to build the specialized kernel.
