\section{Main Use Case}
\label{sec:main-use-case}

Porting QEMU as a library in Unikraft benefits both Unikraft and Xen, firstly, by expanding the unikernel project reach and secondly, by replacing a long outdated piece of software: the MiniOS based model devices.
The XenProject community is planing on adopting the technology and expanding it to other MiniOS stubdomains, such as the Xenstored one, currently running as a deamon inside dom0, and the virtual TPM stubdom, which was long ago marked as stale.
\labelindexref{Figure}{img:disk-writes} clearly demonstrates the need to provide XenProject with a unikernel based model device, a more sophisticated one at that.
There is significant room for expanding the project reach accross multiple communities, but the most interested one would be XenProject.
